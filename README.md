# Conversion Rate 

## Project ðŸš§
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be cut into four steps :

- Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file data_train.csv
- Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
- Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file data_test.csv. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA ðŸ¤“). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
- Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?




# The North Face ecommerce

## Project ðŸš§
The marketing department would like to take advantage of machine learning solutions to boost online sales on the website : https://www.thenorthface.fr/

They have identified two major solutions that could have a huge effect on the conversion rates :

Deploying a recommender system that will allow to suggest additionnal products to users, that are similar to the items they are already interested in. The recommendations could be materialized by a "you might also be interested by these products..." section that would appear on each product page of the website.
Improving the structure of the products catalog thanks to topic extraction. The idea is to use unsupervised methods to challenge the existing categories : is it possible to find new categories of product that would be more suitable for the navigation on the website ?

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be cut into three steps :

- Identify groups of products that have similar descriptions.
- Use the groups of similar products to build a simple recommender system algorithm.
- Use topic modeling algorithms to automatically assess the latent topics present in the item descriptions.





# Walmart Sales

## Project ðŸš§
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
- Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
- Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model
